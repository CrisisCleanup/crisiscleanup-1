The approval process is two steps: Verification and Activation.  You, the administrator, verifies that this group is eligible to participate in Crisis Cleanup.  Once you verify this organization, the contact(s) will receive an email notification asking them to activate their account.

The activation process requires the contact to answer a few easy questions about how Crisis Cleanup works. The purpose of activation is to make sure that at least one person in that organization has received a minimum amount of training. The questions are not designed to be hard; just to make them think.

As soon as the contact has answered a few questions correctly, the will receive their passcode on the screen and in an email.  They should share this organizational username and passcode with everyone in their organization who will interact with Crisis Cleanup.
