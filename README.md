Crisis Cleanup
==============

Crisis Cleanup is a web platform that connects disaster recovery organization volunteers with people who need help after a disaster. The Crisis Cleanup platform has been used to connected 40,000+ volunteers from 300+ organizations with 15,000 families in 17 states and 20 disasters in 4 countries.

Crisis Cleanup works best in a collaborative environment where multiple agencies and voluntary organizations work together and coordinate efforts. Because these organizations do not take orders from one another, Crisis Cleanup is designed to facilitate Collaborative Accountability models of inter-agency interaction, rather than command-and-control operations, or or heirarchical accountability models of interaction. 

This is the repository for the main Crisis Cleanup web application, a map-based co-ordination tool using the Google Appengine platform
