<h1>Welcome to CrisisCleanup.org</h1>
<p>We have received your application. Once approved, you will receive an email with instructions and your organizational password.</p>
<p>Because the collaborative work order tracking tool contains identifying client information, only government entities and organizations of established reputation who are actively taking or fulfilling clean-up requests in the wake of disasters, and have a physical presence in the region will be granted access to this system. Access is by invitation and may be revoked at any time if there is evidence of abuse, improper use of client information, or if your organization is no longer active in recovery efforts.  <strong>The tool is provided "as is" without any warranty of fitness for any particular purpose.</strong></p>
<p>Crisiscleanup.org is set up so that <em>no single organization is in charge of the entire system</em>.  Consider it a "Craigslist" approach to disaster recovery.  Organizations aware of a need place the request in the system.  Organizations capable of meeting the needs then "claim" the work order and perform it.  Some oversight is necessary to make sure that no work orders are forgotten, and the technology permits (but does not require) such oversight.</p>
<p>Ideally every organization that accepts work orders places the work order directly into the system and then keeps track of it to make sure that someone has addressed it.  On average, dozens or hundreds of new work orders enter the system every day. We encourage you to keep close track of the information entered in the areas you are working.</p>
