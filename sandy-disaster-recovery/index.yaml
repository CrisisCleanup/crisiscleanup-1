indexes:

# manually specified indexes on Site for WorkOrderSearchForm and similar
# to use 'zigzag merging' and avoid combinatorial definition of indexes
#
# Structure: for all filterable fields f, for all sort orders o,
# create index for (f, o ascending), (f, o descending)
#
# (for rationale, see https://developers.google.com/appengine/articles/indexselection )

# AUTOGENERATED

# This index.yaml is automatically updated whenever the dev_appserver
# detects that a new type of query is run.  If you want to manage the
# index.yaml file manually, remove the above marker line (the line
# saying "# AUTOGENERATED").  If you want to manage some indexes
# manually, move them above the marker line.  The index.yaml file is
# automatically uploaded to the admin console when you next deploy
# your application using appcfg.py.
