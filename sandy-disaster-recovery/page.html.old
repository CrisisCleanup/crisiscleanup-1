             <h2>We're showing that we <i>can</i> bring organizations together to share information</h2>
             <p>This project came out of the aftermath of Occupy Sandy. In the first days and weeks after the storm, one of the biggest challenges faced was that of organizational overlap. One side of a street might have been contacted several times, by several different organizations. While the other side of the street was left uncanvassed. This lead to survey fatigue, asymmetric aide, and volunteers who were frustrated because it wasn't clear what needed to be done. We wanted to do better for ourselves and our neighbors. So far, we are collaborating with over 100 organizations, with more signing up every day. <strong>CrisisCleanup.org proves that it is possible to create a near frictionless technological platform where inter-organization Cooperation, Communication, Coordination, and Collaboration is not only convenient, but required.</strong></p>
